This package contains protoype Python classes for representing raw images and perhaps master biases in the  `LSST Science Pipelines <https://pipelines.lsst.io>`_.
It may eventually become a solid proposal to replace *some* usage of ``lsst.afw.image.Exposure``, but right now it's just a sketchboard.
