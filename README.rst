This package contains prototype Python classes for representing raw images and perhaps master biases in the  `LSST Science Pipelines <https://pipelines.lsst.io>`_.
It represents the beginning of a proposal to replace *some* usage of ``lsst.afw.image.Exposure`` and ``lsst.afw.cameraGeom`` in our representation of raw images, Instrument Signature Removal (ISR), and perhaps the earliest steps of the Calibration Production Pipelines.
